<p>jQuery is a JavaScript Library.
<br>
jQuery greatly simplifies JavaScript programming.</p>

<p>
	What is jQuery?
jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

<p>
	Why jQuery?
There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.

Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:

Google
Microsoft
IBM
Netflix
</p>

<p>
	jQuery CDN
If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

Google is an example of someone who host jQuery:

	The Document Ready Event
You might have noticed that all jQuery methods in our examples, are inside a document ready event:

$(document).ready(function(){

  // jQuery methods go here...

});
</pre>

<!-- example-1 -->
<h1>example-1</h1>
<h2>This is a heading</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
<button>Click me</button>


<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("button").click(function(){
    $("p").hide();
  });
});
</script>
